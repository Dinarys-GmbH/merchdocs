The _Conversion rate (add-to-cart)_ recommends products with the highest add-to-cart conversion rate.

## How it works

The _Conversion rate (add-to-cart)_ recommendation type calculates the proportion of sessions with a product view that register a subsequent add-to-cart event for the same SKU. Simple put, out of all the shopper sessions that viewed the product, what percentage ended up adding that product to their cart?
