title: Conversion rate (add-to-cart)
---

The _Conversion rate (add-to-cart)_ displays products that are ranked by a predicted conversion rate and prioritizes the eligible products that are most likely to be added to a cart.

## How it works

The _Conversion rate (add-to-cart)_ recommendation type calculates the proportion of sessions where the product was viewed and then was added to the cart.
